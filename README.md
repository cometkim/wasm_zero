# wasm_zero

A lightweight WASM FFI binding generator and [rkyv](https://rkyv.org/)
serialization wrapper between TypeScript and Rust. Built for **`no_std`** wasm
targets — no `wasm-bindgen`, no JS glue runtime, no allocator assumptions beyond
your own.

🌐 **Live demo:** https://daksh14.github.io/wasm_zero/

Annotate a Rust function with `#[wasm_zero]`, and wasm_zero gives you:

- an exported FFI shim that returns the function's result as an
  [rkyv](https://rkyv.org/) zero-copy archive, and
- generated, **self-contained** TypeScript/JavaScript bindings that call the
  shim and read each field straight out of wasm memory — no runtime library on
  the read path, no extra serialization layer.

```rust
#[wasm_zero]
pub fn get_adult_person() -> Person { /* ... */ }
```

```js
import { initWasmZero } from "./pkg/bindings.js";

const wasmzero = await initWasmZero("app.wasm");
const person = wasmzero.get_adult_person(); // -> { name, age, email, scores }
```

## Why

### Motivation

This library exists to enable and skyrocket WASM application development that
touches the frontend — and to make the web a faster and more secure place. Rust
compiled to WASM gives you memory safety and near-native speed; wasm_zero
removes the friction of getting that power to the browser. You annotate a Rust
function, and wasm_zero emits a JavaScript/TypeScript shim you can drop straight
into a bare `.html` file — no bundler, no glue runtime, no `std` assumption. The 
same emitted wasm can be run on the server with wasmtime or a self hosted VM.
To allow wasi targets set  `--target wasm32-wasi` as target.
`wasm-bindgen` is excellent but pulls in a JS glue.

For small `no_std` wasm modules that just need to hand structured data to a
JavaScript host, that's a lot of machinery. wasm_zero takes a different tack:

- The Rust side serializes return values with rkyv into a flat byte buffer.
- The JS side reads that buffer field-by-field straight from wasm memory, using
  readers generated from your Rust types — no hand-maintained schema files and
  no runtime decode library. Strings still use TextDecoder which has a runtime
  cost along with branching for SSO.
- The only ABI surface is a handful of integer-in/integer-out functions plus
  linear memory. In the future we want to provide a way to provide a validated
  abi at compile time for custom ABI needs

## At Dusk Network: exu

At [Dusk Network](https://dusk.network/) we engineered a glue layer that runs on
`no_std`, is secure and sandboxed, and executes efficiently in the browser
*without blocking* the main thread by running inside Web Workers — alongside
wasm_zero.

That runtime is [`exu`](https://github.com/dusk-network/exu). It works in the
web browser or the Node.js runtime to run your WASM with:

- **Web Workers** in the browser and **actual OS-level threads** in Node.js, so
  invocations run off the main thread, non-blockingly.
- **Sandboxing** — your WASM runs isolated. After a function invocation exu can
  delete the WASM memory and drop the worker entirely, so nothing leaks between
  calls.

We maintain a **fork of exu** (vendored in [`exu/`](exu)) that extends upstream
with a [**rayon**](https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon) thread pool running over
*shared* wasm memory — no `wasm-bindgen` required. The fork keeps exu's
sandboxing model intact: the sandbox boundary is the *wasm instance + memory*,
not the worker. Workers are pooled and reused across tasks, while a **fresh
`WebAssembly.Memory` is minted per task** so nothing leaks between
invocations — yet *within* a task, the rayon pool's worker threads all share
that one memory for zero-copy parallelism (`SharedArrayBuffer` + atomics).

### Example: sandboxing + a shared-memory rayon pool

Each `module.task(...)` runs in its own sandbox over fresh memory (terminated
when the task resolves). Inside the task, `initThreadPool(threads)` stands up a
rayon pool whose workers share that sandbox's memory, so a parallel compute call
fans out across cores without copying:

```js
import { Module } from "./exu/src/mod.js";

const module = new Module(new URL("wasm_zero_rayon.wasm", import.meta.url));
module.defaultImports = new URL("imports.js", import.meta.url);

// Run a task: fresh sandbox + memory, dropped when this resolves (sandboxing).
const result = await module.task(async (exports, { initThreadPool }) => {
  // Spin up a rayon pool over this sandbox's shared memory.
  const threads = await initThreadPool(navigator.hardwareConcurrency);
  const primes = await exports.__wasm_zero_parallel_count_primes(1_000_000);
  return { primes, threads };
})();

console.log(result); // { primes: 78498, threads: <cores> }
```

The next `module.task(...)` gets a brand-new memory (sandboxed), while the
underlying workers are recycled from the pool. The
[`wasm_zero_rayon`](crates/wasm_zero_rayon) crate provides the compute functions
and the thread-pool bootstrap; see
[`exu/tests/rayon_deno_test.mjs`](exu/tests/rayon_deno_test.mjs) for the
end-to-end run (verified under Deno, ~3.8× on 10 threads) and
[`exu/tests/mandelbrot_deno_test.mjs`](exu/tests/mandelbrot_deno_test.mjs) for a
parallel Mandelbrot render that reads the RGBA buffer straight out of shared
memory.

> **Note:** shared memory needs cross-origin isolation —
> `wasm_zero_serve` stamps `COOP`/`COEP` on every response so
> `SharedArrayBuffer` is available in the browser.

## How it works

```text
#[wasm_zero] fn foo() -> T
        │
        ├── wasm_zero_macro (proc macro, compile time)
        │     emits  __wasm_zero_foo(out_ptr: u32) -> u32
        │     which rkyv-serializes T and writes [len: u32][bytes] at out_ptr
        │
        └── wasm_zero_build (build.rs, before compile)
              scans the source and emits pkg/bindings.{ts,js}:
                • per-struct readers (decode_Person reads each field)
                • FFI client         (initWasmZero / wasmzero.foo())
```

A proc macro can only return tokens to the compiler — it can't write files. A
`build.rs` runs *before* the compiler and can. So the two responsibilities are
split: the macro transforms code, the build helper emits the binding artifacts.
This is the same division `prost`/`prost-build` and `uniffi` use.

### The FFI / memory protocol

For each `#[wasm_zero] fn foo(args...) -> T`:

1. The module exports a shim plus `malloc` / `free` (from `wasm_zero::mem`).
   Nullary functions export `__wasm_zero_foo(out_ptr) -> u32`; functions with
   arguments export `__wasm_zero_foo(in_ptr, out_ptr) -> u32`.
2. Arguments that are scalar primitives (`i8`…`u64`, `f32`, `f64`, `bool`) are
   passed **directly as wasm function parameters** — no encoding, no input
   buffer (the fast path). If any argument is non-scalar (`String`, a struct,
   `Vec`, …), all args are instead rkyv-encoded (`r.encode`) into an input
   buffer (`[len][bytes]`) and `in_ptr` is passed.
3. If the return type is a scalar primitive or `()`, the shim **returns it
   directly** as the wasm function's return value — no output buffer, no rkyv,
   no error code (it can't fail). Otherwise it writes
   `[len: u32 little-endian][rkyv archive bytes]` at `out_ptr` and returns an
   [`ErrorCode`](crates/wasm_zero/src/error.rs) (`Ok == 0`).
4. For buffer returns, JS reads `len` and decodes **straight from wasm memory**
   using a generated per-struct reader — each field read at its archived offset
   (scalars via `DataView`, numeric vecs as zero-copy typed-array views, strings
   transcoded on demand). No runtime library is involved on the read path.
   Scalar/unit returns are just the call's return value.

Both directions use the same `[len][bytes]` framing (the archive starts at a
16-byte-aligned offset so typed-array views are correctly aligned).

rkyv is configured for the standard v0.8 format: little-endian, aligned
primitives, **32-bit relative pointers**, root at the end of the buffer.

## Workspace layout

| Crate | Role |
|-------|------|
| [`wasm_zero`](crates/wasm_zero) | `no_std` runtime library: the `#[wasm_zero]` re-export, `ErrorCode`, and `mem` (malloc/free + buffer helpers). |
| [`wasm_zero_macro`](crates/wasm_zero_macro) | The `#[wasm_zero]` attribute proc macro that emits the FFI shim. |
| [`wasm_zero_build`](crates/wasm_zero_build) | `build.rs` helper that generates the self-contained TS/JS bindings (`bindings.ts` + `bindings.js`). |
| [`wasm_zero_serve`](crates/wasm_zero_serve) | Tiny axum static-file server for running the demo pages. |
| [`wasm_zero_test_nostd`](crates/wasm_zero_test_nostd) | `no_std` demo: rkyv types + `#[wasm_zero]` functions + a browser page. |
| [`wasm_zero_test`](crates/wasm_zero_test) | A `wasm-bindgen`/`std` comparison crate. |
| [`wasm_zero_rayon`](crates/wasm_zero_rayon) | Shared-memory rayon compute fns (`parallel_count_primes`, …) + the thread-pool bootstrap, driven by the exu fork. |
| [`wasm_zero_rayon_demo`](crates/wasm_zero_rayon_demo) | Parallel Mandelbrot render over shared wasm memory (returns an RGBA pointer JS reads zero-copy). |

There's also a standalone [`benchmark/`](benchmark) workspace comparing
`wasm-bindgen` and `wasm_zero` head-to-head — call overhead, data transfer, and
**bundle size** (`benchmark/sizes.sh`: wasm_zero ships ~2.2× smaller gzipped —
5.8 KB vs 12.8 KB — with no glue runtime and no read-path dependency at all).

## Usage

### 1. Add the dependencies

```toml
[dependencies]
wasm_zero = "0.1"
rkyv = { version = "0.8", default-features = false, features = ["alloc", "pointer_width_32"] }

[build-dependencies]
wasm_zero_build = "0.1"
```

### 2. Annotate your types and functions

```rust
#![no_std]
extern crate alloc;
use alloc::string::String;
use alloc::vec::Vec;

use rkyv::{Archive, Deserialize, Serialize};
use wasm_zero::wasm_zero;

#[derive(Archive, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct Person {
    pub name: String,
    pub age: u32,
    pub email: Option<String>,
    pub scores: Vec<u32>,
}

#[wasm_zero]
pub fn get_adult_person() -> Person {
    Person { /* ... */ }
}
```

### 3. Generate the bindings from `build.rs`

```rust
fn main() {
    // Writes pkg/bindings.ts and pkg/bindings.js
    wasm_zero_build::generate("src/lib.rs", "pkg");
}
```

This produces a **self-contained** FFI client — a TypeScript interface plus a
zero-copy reader per struct, with no runtime dependency:

```ts
export interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  email: string | null;
  scores: Uint32Array; // zero-copy view over wasm memory
}

// reads each field straight from wasm memory at its archived offset
function decode_Person(dv, u8, p) { /* ... */ }

export async function initWasmZero(wasmUrl: string | URL, imports?: WebAssembly.Imports): Promise<WasmZero>;
```

Two files are emitted from one model:

- **`bindings.ts`** — plain TypeScript interfaces + typed client.
- **`bindings.js`** — the same module with types stripped, importable directly
  in a browser (no bundler, no CDN).

`rkyv-js` is imported **only** if a function takes a non-scalar argument
(`String`/struct/…) — it's used to `r.encode` the argument into the input buffer
(hand-rolling the rkyv *writer* is out of scope). The read path never needs it.

### 4. Build the wasm and call it

```bash
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown -p your_crate
```

```html
<script type="module">
  import { initWasmZero } from './pkg/bindings.js';
  const wasmzero = await initWasmZero('your_crate.wasm');
  console.log(wasmzero.get_adult_person());
</script>
<!-- Only if a function takes a non-scalar argument, the bindings import
     rkyv-js; add an import map then:
     <script type="importmap">
       { "imports": { "rkyv-js": "https://esm.sh/gh/cometkim/rkyv-js" } }
     </script> -->
```

## Running the demo

```bash
# Build the no_std demo wasm
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown -p wasm_zero_test_nostd

# Serve the workspace (defaults to http://127.0.0.1:8000)
cargo run -p wasm_zero_serve
```

Then open <http://127.0.0.1:8000/crates/wasm_zero_test_nostd/index.html>. The
page imports the generated `pkg/bindings.js`, calls `greet()` and
`get_adult_person()`, and renders the decoded values.

## `no_std` notes

The demo crate shows the expected setup for a `no_std` cdylib:

- a `#[global_allocator]` (the demo uses `dlmalloc`),
- a `#[panic_handler]` (`core::arch::wasm32::unreachable()`),
- `panic = "abort"` (via `.cargo/config.toml`) so no `eh_personality` is needed.

## Optimizing the wasm

wasm_zero already minimizes per-call work: scalar args/returns are bare wasm
calls (no buffer), the shim **serializes directly into the output buffer** (no
intermediate allocation or copy), and numeric vecs return zero-copy views.

For the smallest, fastest module, tune the consuming crate's release profile:

```toml
[profile.release]
opt-level = "z"    # smallest; use 3 for fastest
lto = "fat"        # cross-crate inlining
codegen-units = 1  # max optimization
strip = true       # drop symbols
```

Then run [`wasm-opt`](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen) on the output
(`wasm-opt -O3 app.wasm -o app.wasm`; needs a recent Binaryen). Building with
`RUSTFLAGS="-C target-feature=+bulk-memory"` enables `memory.copy`/`fill` for
faster byte copies where your targets support it.

## Supported types

wasm_zero reads these Rust types from the archive into TypeScript:

| Rust | TypeScript |
|------|------------|
| `u8`–`i32`, `f32`, `f64`, `usize`/`isize` | `number` |
| `u64`, `i64` | `bigint` |
| `bool` | `boolean` |
| `char`, `String` | `string` |
| `Vec<T>` of a numeric primitive | `Uint32Array` / `Float64Array` / … (zero-copy view) |
| `Vec<T>` (other) | `T[]` |
| `Option<T>` | `T \| null` |
| `Box<T>` / `Rc<T>` / `Arc<T>` | `T` |
| `#[derive(Archive)] struct` | `interface` |

Enums, maps, tuples, and `[T; N]` arrays aren't read yet (the build fails with a
clear message). The reader is generated from the rkyv archived layout; for the
non-scalar **argument** path, encoding uses [rkyv-js](https://github.com/cometkim/rkyv-js).

### Argument handling

wasm_zero picks the cheapest way to pass arguments based on their types:

| Arguments | How they cross | Cost |
|-----------|----------------|------|
| none | nullary shim | — |
| all scalar primitives (`i8`…`u64`, `f32`, `f64`, `bool`) | passed **directly as wasm params** | none — like a bare call |
| any non-scalar (`String`, struct, `Vec`, …) | rkyv-encoded (`r.encode`) into the input buffer | one encode + copy |

(i64/u64 args are passed as JS `BigInt`.)

### Return handling

Return values are read **straight from wasm memory** by a generated per-struct
reader (`decode_<Struct>`) — each field at its archived offset, no runtime
library:

| Return type | How it crosses | Result |
|-------------|----------------|--------|
| scalar primitive or `()` | **returned directly** as the wasm function's value — a bare call, no buffer (matches wasm_bindgen) | `number` / `bigint` / `boolean` / `void` |
| `Vec<T>` of a numeric primitive | **zero-copy typed-array view** (`Uint32Array`, `Float64Array`, …) over the archived elements | a view that **aliases** wasm memory |
| struct / `String` / `Option` / `Vec<T>` / nested | fields read directly at their offsets (`DataView`/views; strings transcoded) | a plain object; numeric-vec fields are views |

Notes:

- **Views alias the shared scratch buffer**, so a returned struct's numeric-vec
  field (or a top-level numeric-vec return) is only valid until the next call on
  that instance (or a `memory.grow`). `.slice()` / copy it to keep it. Scalar and
  string fields are owned (copied) and safe to keep.
- The rkyv layout for numeric vecs is native little-endian, so the view needs no
  copy and no per-element decode. Strings are always materialized (UTF-8 →
  UTF-16) when read.

This is why, in the [benchmark](benchmark), `wasm_zero` matches or beats
wasm_bindgen on scalar calls and numeric-array returns; for full struct
materialization with strings, serde-wasm-bindgen's single-pass build is still
a touch faster, while wasm_zero wins when you read only some fields.

## Limitations

- Arguments must be **owned** rkyv types (e.g. `i32`, `String`, a `#[derive(Archive)]`
  struct) — borrowed parameters like `&str` aren't decodable from the input
  buffer. Non-scalar arguments require `rkyv-js` (for encoding).
- The generated readers cover scalars, `String`, `Option`, `Vec`, `Box`/`Rc`/`Arc`,
  and `#[derive(Archive)]` structs. Enums, maps, and tuples aren't read yet
  (the build fails with a clear message).
- Only the standard rkyv v0.8 format is supported (little-endian, aligned,
  32-bit pointers).
